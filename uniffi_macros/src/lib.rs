/// A macro to build testcases for a component's generated bindings.
///
/// This macro provides some plumbing to write automated tests for the generated
/// foreign language bindings of a component. As a component author, you can write
/// script files in the target foreign language(s) that exercise you component API,
/// and then call this macro to produce a `cargo test` testcase from each one.
/// The generated code will execute your script file with appropriate configuration and
/// environment to let it load the component bindings, and will pass iff the script
/// exits successfully.
///
/// To use it, invoke the macro with the interface definition file as the first
/// argument, then one or more file paths relative to the crate root directory.
/// It will produce one `#[test]` function per file, in a manner designed to
/// play nicely with `cargo test` and its test filtering options.

/// A macro to generate and include UniFFI component scaffolding.
///
/// This macro that can be used by UniFFI component crates to automatically generate
/// and include the UniFFI component scaffolding and include it into their Rust code
/// without the need for a separate `.udl` file or a separate build step. It can be
/// be used like this:
///
/// ```rs
///
/// #[uniffi_macros::declare_interface]
/// mod my_example {
///
///     // The Rust code to implement the component goes inside here.
///
///     pub struct Example {
///         pub fn hello(&self) -> String {
///             String::new("world")
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The contents of the inline module must be Rust code that can be parsed into a UniFFI
/// `ComponentInterface`, which means that it must satisfy a variety of restrictions so
/// that UniFFI can correctly understand it. (The precise details of those restrictions
/// are still being defined...).
///
/// After parsing the contents of the inline module, the macro will generate accompanying
/// Rust scaffolding code to expose it via an `extern "C"` FFI and will lift the resulting
/// code up to the top level of the containing module. The result makes the declared interface
/// available both to other Rust consumers (via the written Rust code), and to bindings from
/// foreign languages (via the generated FFI).
///
/// Ideally, this macro would work as an *inner* attribute on a module, so that users
/// could write this at the top-level of their Rust code rather than using an inline
/// submodule:
///
/// ```rs
///
/// #![uniffi_macros::declare_interface]
///
/// // The Rust code to implement the component just follows the macro.
///
/// pub struct Example {
///     pub fn hello(&self) -> String {
///         String::new("world")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Unfortunately, inner attributes at the top level of a crate are still unstable, and
/// even when enabled are quite fiddly to work with. But maybe one day..!
